# ZombieDiceGame

This package contains the code needed to run the game 'Zombie Dice'. Feel free to try it out! All the code is located in the directory 'Sources'. I have moved the .swift files into different directories: EquipmentModule, GameModules, PlayersModules, TableModule, ZombieDiceGame. Each one of them has one purpose in making the game as it is.

If you run the game the first thing to pop up is a start menu which has two options: 1. Start the game and 2. Ask for instructions. If you choose the second option (type the key "2" and then hit enter) the you will be given some basic tips on what the game is and how to play this console game. After reading the tips, you need to press enter in order to start the game. Have fun!
